ðŸ“˜ Chapter 1: Introduction to C++

Q.1. What is C++?
    C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose compiled programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s.
    It supports multiple programming paradigms including:
        * Procedural programming (like C)
        * Object-oriented programming
        * Generic programming using templates
    C++ combines the power of C with the modern features like classes, objects, inheritance, and more.

ðŸ“š Key Features of C++
    Feature	                            Description
    Compiled	                        Converts source code to machine code
    Fast Execution	                    Close to hardware, minimal overhead
    OOP Support	                        Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
    STL (Standard Template Library)	    In-built data structures and algorithms
    Portable	                        Runs on different operating systems
    Extensible	                        You can add new features easily

ðŸ“† History of C++
    Year	                    Event
    1979	                    Bjarne Stroustrup begins work on "C with Classes"
    1983	                    Renamed to C++
    1998	                    First official ISO standard
    C++11 / 14 / 17 / 20 / 23	Modern versions with big improvements like auto, lambda, ranges, modules, etc.

Q.2. Why Learn C++ in 2025?
    * Fastest language after C
    * Loved by Competitive Programmers (Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.)
    * FAANG interviews prefer C++ for performance
    * Big STL support (vectors, maps, stacks, etc.)
    * Deep understanding of memory & logic
